* Implemented JAVA program that simulates commercial trades between three companies. 

* Each company has:
  - 50 depots
  - one slot that holds native products in each depot
  - two slots that hold each of external products in each depot


* Once a simulation begins:
  - Each company OBJ is created having a random number of native products generated at each depot. 
  - Each depot in a company then attempts to sell its native products to other companies 
  - and to buy native products -which become external products-  from a depot of other companies picked in random.


## Else
* ArrayList was only used to hold OBJs
