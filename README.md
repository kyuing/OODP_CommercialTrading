* Implemented JAVA program that simulates commercial trades between three companies. 

* Each company has:
  - 50 depots
  - one slot that holds native products in each depot
  - two slots that hold each of external products in each depot


* Once the program starts in console, a simulation begins:
  - Each company OBJ is created having a random number of native products generated at each depot. 
  - Each depot in a company then simulates to sell its native products to other companies 
    (In other words, each depot in companies each attempts to buy external products from a depot of other companies picked in random.) 
  - Any result printed is the output of a single simulation.


## Else
* ArrayList was only used to hold OBJs
